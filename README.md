# üíª WPF - Tasks.Show

![Example Picture](./ScreenShot.png)

### üìù v1.0.1.5 - February 2022

* I do not remember where I got this original code, but I have reworked this entire project. I believe it was part of an old *Microsoft* WPF samples repo. If I had to guess I would say the original code write was around 2011.
* I had to refactor much of this code base as the `Task` object was not released at the time; that's how old it is! So naturally this caused the compiler much confusion once I updated the framework.
* I have updated the **.NET Framwork** to version `4.6.2`, but it could be taken to version `4.8` without issues.
* It uses the additional packages:
    - WindowsAPICodePack
    - PixelLab
